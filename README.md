## Kotlin Wrapper Library for Gemini's RestAPI

This is a Kotlin wrapper library for Gemini's RestAPI, a lightweight library that does not require the Android SDK. Currently, it is JVM-only.

See [RestAPI specifications](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/rest_quickstart?hl=en).

## Running the Example

To run the example, set your Gemini API key as an environment variable and execute the Gradle run command:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
./gradlew run
```

Look at org.example.ITTest.kt as sample usage.
